order: 90
---

To make some banana mash, you need a banana.

Have you found a banana? ^[ There is a banana in the basement. Go left from the dragon and get it from the compost ]

# I have a banana
And there is a mixer in the kitchen. Quite clear.

# The mixer does not work
It is _battery powered_...

## Where do I get batteries?
Look at the remote control in your inventory. You get two batteries. Use them on the mixer.

Insert the banana into the mixed and you get yourself some banana mash!
