There is a television next to Banannan's cauldron.

Maybe you should try to turn it on.

But before that, [enter Banannan's room](squeaky-door).

# How do I turn the television on?
It does not have any buttons.

Try to find a remote control. ^[ The teddy bear is holding the remote button. ]

# But the television is missing the antenna
You would need a _makeshift antenna_.

Some metallic object should be good for that.

# Like what?
Like a hanger.

[Wardrobes](wardrobe) usually have a hanger. ^[ After [opening the wardrobe](wardrobe) take the cat suit and then take the hanger ]
