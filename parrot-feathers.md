Geoff the Parrot is not that cooperative to part his feathers.

# What should I do to him?
He said he likes to look at people in their birthday suits.

## Where do I get those?
The "newspaper" Banannan is reading actually has one on the cover.

[Turn the television on](television) and you can get the magazine. Show it to Geoff.

# I should hang the magazien somewhere
This is a pixel hunt. ^[ There is a hook right from Geoff. Use the magazine on the hook. ]

After Geoff is staring the magazine, you can get some of his feathers.
