title: A dragon scale
order: 80
---

One ingredient is a dragon scale from the basement.

Talk to Sweet Tooth. She promises you a scale if you get her some [cookies](cookies).

# The cookies didn't make it
But Gurk is a "dragon", too. He has his own scales.

He probably spreads them all over the place.

## Where do I get the scales?
Check the bed. You get scales from the bed.
