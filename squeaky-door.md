The wooden door into Banannan's room is really squeaky.

Banannan will hear if you open it.

# Any hints on the squeaky door?
Maybe you should _grease_ the door hinges.

## Where do I find grease?
There is a barrel of lard in the kitchen. Use that to grease the door.

# How do I get some of that lard?
Try to find a container to get some of the lard. ^[ Go downstairs and take the mug in front of the bed. ]
